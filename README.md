# enterprise-observability-pipeline-at-scale
Automated a high-scale observability pipeline for 500+ nodes using Jenkins, Ansible, &amp; ELK with Kafka. By treating Cloud VMs as "bare-metal" on-premise servers, I solved for log durability and system metrics at scale, moving from manual monitoring to a resilient, real-time DevOps ecosystem.
